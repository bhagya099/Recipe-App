# Recipe-App
I made a APP where you can share you awesome food recipe with others.
For making this APP I use HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS.
In index.html I creat a form where you can add your recipe name and instructions. for that I use form tag and inside I use input and label tags.
 For looks good I use css in main.css file.
for interacting it I use vanilla js in main.js
