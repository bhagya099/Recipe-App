# Recipe-App
I made a APP where you can save you awesome food recipe for future.

For making this APP I use HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS.

In index.html I creat a form where you can add your recipe name and instructions. for that I use form tag and inside I use input and label tags.

 For looks good I use css in main.css file.
 
for interacting it I use vanilla js in main.js

I created 2 JS files "index.js" and "recipe.j ... creat a class and in that class creat an empty array for pushing all recipes in that array and add method with parameters .. 

In index file I grab all the value from html using variables and then creat instance of class and push that values using add method.

What to accomplish


1.A user should be  able to add new recipes to his Recipe App.

2.When the user clicks on ‘add recipe', he should be able to add a new recipe on page.

3.The user should be able to add a ‘recipe name', a place for the directions to make the recipe, and be able to add of ingredients.

4.Clicking on delete button user can  delete the recipe, if necessary.

5.The app should also save items to local storage.
