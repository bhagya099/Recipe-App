# Recipe-App
I made a APP where you can share you awesome food recipe with others.
For making this APP I use HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS.
In index.html I creat a form where you can add your recipe name and instructions. for that I use form tag and inside I use input and label tags.
 For looks good I use css in main.css file.
for interacting it I use vanilla js in main.js
I created 2 JS files "index.js" and "recipe.j ... creat a class and in that class creat an empty array .and add method with parameters .. 
In index file I grab all the value from html using variables and then creat instance of class and push that values in that array.
